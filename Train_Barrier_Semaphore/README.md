### OPEN-SMART Traffic Light

#### Description

This is a mini-traffic light display module, high brightness, very suitable for the production of traffic light system model.

Features:

* Number of lights: 3
* Light color: red, yellow and green
* Active level: high level
* Operating voltage: 5V / 3.3V
* Operating current: When you use 5V high level output, the red light 13mA, yellow light 13mA, green light 25mA.
* Can be connected to the motherboard's PWM pin to control the brightness of the light.

### Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04

Description:
* The module performance is stable, measure the distance accurately:
* Can and SRF05, SRF02 ultrasonic distance measuring module and other comparable. Module precision, blind spots (2cm) super close, stable ranging success of this product to market under the strong!

Feature:
* Voltage: DC5V
* Static current: less than 2mA
* Level output: high-5V
* Level output: the end of 0V
* Sensor angle: not more than 15 degrees
* Detection distance: 2cm-450cm
* High precision: up to 0.3cm
* Connection: VCC, trig (control side), echo (receiving end), GND

Usage:
* 10US a control population of more than a high-fat, you can wait to receive high output port. A timer can be opened with the output timing, when the port goes low when the timer value can be read this when the time for this distance, only calculate the distance. This constant cycle of measurement, you can reach the value of the mobile measurement.

Module works:
* The IO trigger location, the high signal to at least 10us;
* The module automatically sends eight 40khz square wave, automatically detects whether a signal return;
* Asignal back, through the IO of a high output, high duration is
* Ultrasonic time from launch to return. Test distance = (time * High speed of sound (340M / S)) /
* This module provides a full set of ranging process: C51, PIC18F877, ultrasonic LCD1602 display, ultrasonic LCD12864 display, LED display, serial display, ranging reference program.

Package Included:
* 1x Ultrasonic Sensor module
